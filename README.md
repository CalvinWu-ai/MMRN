# MMRN

1. The Technometric folder contains the codes for the existing methods solving the DCOV-based SDR model and the DCOV-based SVS model 

2. The MM folder contains the codes for our proposed method, mainly including MMRN.m (solving the DCOV-based SDR model),
    PMMRN.m (solving the DCOV-based SVS model), PMMRNBic (PMMRN with the BIC criterion), and MNewton.m (the Riemannian Newton's step)

3.  Model_A-C.m and ModelA_High-ModelC_High.m are codes for the comparison of our algorithm and Yin's for the DCOV-based SDR method, and
     study1-4.m are codes for the comparison of our algorithm and Chen's for the DCOV-based SVS method.

You can run the demo.m for a comparision of our algorithm and Yin's in which we visualize DCOV-based SDR method by recovering a cirle.
